The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

The issue arises when the `div` elements do not have enough horizontal space to fit side-by-side. In some cases, the elements might overlap or wrap unexpectedly. This is because the `float` property can lead to unpredictable layout behavior when the available space is constrained.
