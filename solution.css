A more robust and consistent solution is to use flexbox:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Include padding and border in the element's total width and height */
  display: flex;
}
```

Flexbox provides a more predictable and cross-browser compatible way to handle layout, especially in situations where space is constrained. The `box-sizing` property ensures that padding and border are included in the element's width calculation.
